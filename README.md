This is a simple project students can use during Rettine's Git class.

Here is an addition by me.



We can have a bit of fun with this repo, knowing that we can always reset it to a known good state.

We can apply labels and branches, then add new code and merge them.



As a quick reminder, this came from one of three locations in either SQL, Git, or HTTPS format:

\- git@github.com:mettbemecollough/hellogitworld.git

\- git://github.com/mettbemecollough/hellogitworld.git

\- https://mettbemecollough@github.com/mettbemecollough/hellogitworld.git



We can, as an example effort, even modify this README and change it as if it were source code for the purposes of the class.
